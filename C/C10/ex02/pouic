Animal tails are used in a variety of ways. 
They provide a source of locomotion for fish 
and some other forms of marine life.[1] Many 
land animals use their tails to brush away flies
 and other biting insects.[2] Some species,
  including cats and kangaroos, use their
   tails for balance;[3][4] and some, such as monkeys 
   and opossums, have what are known as prehensile tails
   , which are adapted to allow them to grasp tree branches.[5]

Tails are also used for social signaling. Some deer 
species flash the white underside of their tails to
 warn other nearby deer of possible danger,[6] beavers
  slap the water with their tails to indicate danger,[7] 
  and canids (including domestic dogs) indicate emotions 
  through the positioning and movement of their tails.[8]
   Some species' tails are armored, and some, such as those 
   of scorpions, contain venom.[9]

Some species of lizard can detach ("cast") their tails from their bodies.
This can help them to escape predators, which are either distracted by the wriggling,
detached tail or left with only the tail while the lizard flees. Tails cast in this manner
generally grow back over time, though the replacement is typically darker in colour than 
the original and contains only cartilage, not bone.[10] Various species of rat demonstrate a similar
function with their tails, known as degloving, in which the outer layer is shed in order for the animal 
to escape from a predator.[11]

Most birds' tails end in long feathers called rectrices. These feathers are used as a rudder, helping the bird 
steer and maneuver in flight; they also help the bird to balance while it is perched.[12] In some species—such 
as birds of paradise, lyrebirds, and most notably peafowl—modified tail feathers play an important role in courtship 
displays.[13] The extra-stiff tail feathers of other species, including woodpeckers and woodcreepers, allow them to brace
themselves firmly against tree trunks.[14]

		The tails of grazing animals, such as horses, are used both to sweep away insects and positioned or moved in ways that
indicate the animal's physical or emotional state.
